## Behavior

- Event cards are clickable to view event details
- Register buttons open the registration flow
- View Details buttons open the event details with registration status
- User dropdown provides access to profile settings and logout
- Notifications icon shows unread system notifications

## Visual Style

- Clean card-based design with subtle shadows
- Event cards with thumbnail images
- Consistent color scheme with primary blue accents
- Clear visual hierarchy with section headers
- Responsive grid layout

## Responsive Considerations

- Cards reflow to single column on mobile devices
- Navigation converts to bottom bar or hamburger menu on mobile
- Maintains readability on all screen sizes
